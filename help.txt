wb: checks for (the simple version of) well-branchedness

gmc: from communicating system to gc, checking generalised multiparty
     compatibility

chorgram: runs gmc transforming the .dot files it generates in
	  graphical formats and displaying some information

project: projects g-choreographies on CFSMs

minproj: as project with minimisation

detproj: as project with determinisation

gc2fsa: as minproj on all participants ('-v' to generate a Haskell
	representation)

gc2pom: returns the pomset semantics (in graphml format) of a
	g-choreography (in .gc format) (cf. [R. Guanciale and
	E. Tuosto, ICE 2016] and journal version [E. Tuosto and
	R. Guanciale, 2018])

gc2gml: transforms a g-choreography in '.gc' format to the graphml
	format

pom2gg: takes in input a pomsets (in graphml format) and tries to
	compute a global graph for which the pomset in input is the
	semantics

chor2dot: transforms in dot format the description of a g-choreography
	  (in .gc format or as the graphml format of a pomset, or else
	  as a graphml file computed with 'diff.py')
