CHORGRAM

A tool chain for

- converting communicating finite state machines (CFSMs) to global choreographies (GCs)
- projecting GCs on CFSMs
- check multiparty compatibility

Chorgram is written in haskell and uses hkc and petrify as auxiliary
tools. The integration between chorgram and hkc and petrify is is
attained with some python scripts. Chorgram uses dot to display CFSMs,
transition systems, global graphs, and semantics



CONTENT 

aux: a directory with configuration files; it is advisable to put in
     aux the directories of hkc and petrify

BCGBridge.hs: from our notation to BCG. This is very much work in progress to
              rely on BCG in order to minimise CFSMs

BranchingProperty.hs: checks the branching property

BuildGlobal.hs: from petri nets in global graphs

CFSM.hs: data and functions on CFSMs

cfsm2gc.py: checks gmc of system of CFSMs and builds its GC

Dependency.hs

DotStuff.hs: configuration for dot

gc2fsa.hs: projects a global graph on its CFSMs in .fsa format

GCGrammar.y: lex/yacc parser generator for the syntax of GCs

GlobalGraph.hs: data and functions on GCs

gmc.hs: generalised multiparty compatibility checker

HKCBridge.hs: transforms CFSMs in the hkc format

Makefile: a makefile

Misc.hs: should I say more?

PartialOrderReduction.hs: compacts p.o.

PetrifyBridge.hs: transforms files to the format of petrify

PetriNet.hs: utils on Petri nets

Representability.hs: representability checker

SemanticGlobalGraphs.hs: computes the semantics of GCs...well, not really yet! The 'sloopy' option is the default, due to my 'lazy' option

gc.hs: extracts the semantics of a GCs and its (non minimised) projections

gc.py: python script for post-processing of the output of gc.hs

SyntacticGlobalGraphs.hs: an editor for GCs

sysparser.hs: parses the process algebraic presentation of systems CFSMs (.sys format)

SystemGrammar.y: lex/yacc parser generator for the process algebraic presentation of systems CFSMs

TS.hs: data structures and functions for manipulating transition systems of CFSMs
